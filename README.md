# Intro-to-R
Introduction to Beginner R Programing. Here you will learn everything from basic R commands! Below you will find some steps to help get you comfortable with R Studion
## Basics
### Arithmetic with R
Within R, you are able to preform basic mathematical functions.
```
# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12

# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28 %% 6
```
### Variable Assignment
Variable is a basic concept in statistical programing. A variable allows you to store a value (eg. 4) or an object (eg. a function description) in R. This value can later be used to easily access the value or the objet that is stored within this variable
```
my_var <_ 4
my_var
```
You can also combine multiple variables into a joined variable
```
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
```
### Basic Data Types in R
R is capable of workign with numerous data types some of the most basic ones to get started with are
  - Demical values (```4.5```) are called numerics
  - Whole numbers (```4```) are called integers, but are also numerics
  - Boolean values (```TRUE``` or ```FALSE```) are called logical
  - Text (or string) values are called characters
Quotation marks around text indications that is a string (```"some text"```)
